My training zone on my DevOps journey.

The DevOps tools I will focus on will be:

 - Bash
 - Github
 - Kubernetes or K8
 - Docker
 - Docker Swarm
 - Jenkins
 - Puppet
 - Chef
 - Terraform
 - npm
 - TeamCity
 - YAML
 - Python
 - Selenium

 Hard work and endless nights after a full time role as an BI/Alteryx Developer.
